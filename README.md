# Resume-Selection-using-Python-and-Machine-Learning
## Problem Statement
Resume selection is a critical step in the recruitment process, and automating it with machine learning can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This project leverages Python and machine learning techniques to develop a system that evaluates resumes based on job descriptions and identifies the most relevant candidates. The workflow includes data extraction, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

1. Data Extraction
The first step involves gathering a dataset of resumes and corresponding job descriptions. Resumes can be in various formats such as .txt, .pdf, or .docx. Data extraction involves:

Parsing Resumes: Tools like PyPDF2 and docx are used to extract text from resume files.
Job Descriptions: These are collected from job portals or created manually based on specific roles.
The extracted text is stored in structured formats, such as a CSV or database, for further analysis.
2. Data Exploration and Understanding
The dataset is explored to understand the structure of resumes and job descriptions.
Common patterns in resume text (e.g., sections like skills, education, and experience) are identified.
Techniques like word clouds and term frequency analysis are used to understand the most common keywords in resumes and job descriptions.
3. Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing ensures that the text data is clean and ready for analysis:

Text Cleaning: Resumes and job descriptions are cleaned by removing punctuation, numbers, and stopwords using libraries like nltk or spaCy.
Tokenization: Text is split into individual words or phrases.
Lemmatization/Stemming: Words are reduced to their base form to standardize variations (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").
Handling Missing Data: Missing or incomplete resume sections are identified and handled appropriately.
4. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering extracts meaningful insights from the text data:

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text into numerical features based on the importance of words in resumes and job descriptions.
Word Embeddings: Techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT are used to create dense vector representations of text.
Keyword Matching: Extracts specific keywords (e.g., skills or certifications) from resumes and calculates their relevance to the job description.
N-Grams: Bi-grams or tri-grams are used to capture contextual phrases in resumes.
Section Segmentation: Resumes are segmented into structured sections such as "Education," "Experience," and "Skills" for targeted analysis.
5. Splitting the Dataset
The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to build the model, while the validation set ensures proper tuning. The test set evaluates the final system's performance.

6. Machine Learning Modeling
Several machine learning algorithms are implemented to classify resumes as relevant or not:

Logistic Regression: A baseline model for binary classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Captures complex decision boundaries for resume relevance.
Random Forest and Gradient Boosting: Ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy.
Neural Networks: Used for advanced classification tasks, especially with word embeddings like BERT.
Similarity Scores: Cosine similarity or Jaccard similarity is calculated between resumes and job descriptions to rank candidates.
7. Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using metrics such as:

Precision: Measures the percentage of correctly identified relevant resumes.
Recall: Measures the system's ability to identify all relevant resumes.
F1 Score: Balances precision and recall.
ROC-AUC Curve: Evaluates the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
8. Deployment
Once a reliable model is developed, it is deployed for practical use:

Web Application: A user-friendly interface built with Flask or Streamlit allows HR professionals to upload resumes and job descriptions for automated evaluation.
Backend Integration: The system can be integrated into existing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) for seamless recruitment.
Real-Time Processing: Enables instant resume screening and ranking.
9. Future Enhancements
Future improvements can include:

Custom Job Descriptions: Enabling recruiters to input custom job requirements for more personalized results.
Dynamic Skill Matching: Automatically updating relevant skills and keywords based on industry trends.
Multilingual Support: Processing resumes in multiple languages using tools like Google Translate API.
Deep Learning Models: Leveraging advanced NLP models like GPT or BERT for enhanced semantic understanding.
This project demonstrates how machine learning can streamline the resume screening process, saving recruiters time and effort. By analyzing resumes and job descriptions with advanced NLP techniques, the system ensures fair and accurate candidate selection, ultimately improving the overall efficiency of the recruitment process.
